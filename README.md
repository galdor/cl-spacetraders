# cl-spacetraders
## Description
This repository contains a Common Lisp system to interact with the
[SpaceTraders](https://spacetraders.io) online game API.

It is based on the [Tungsten](https://github.com/galdor/tungsten) toolkit and
currently runs on either [SBCL](http://sbcl.org/) or
[CCL](https://ccl.clozure.com/).

## Licensing
The cl-spacetraders project is open source software distributed under the
[ISC](https://opensource.org/licenses/ISC) license.

## Contributions
### Open source, not open contribution
[Similar to SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html), cl-spacetraders is
open source but not open contribution for multiple reasons:

- It avoid potential intellectual property and licensing issues.
- It removes the burden of reviewing patches and maintaining the resulting
  code.
- It helps keeping the software focused on a clear vision.

While this might be disappointing to you, this choice helps me continue to
build and maintain cl-spacetraders.

### Bug reporting
I am thankful for any bug report. Feel free to open issues and include as much
useful information as possible. I cannot however guarantee that I will fix
every bug.

### Ideas and feature suggestions
Ideas and suggestions are welcome, either on GitHub or by
[email](mailto:nicolas@n16f.net).
